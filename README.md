# ðŸ¥§ Recipe App â€“ Personal UX/UI Concept for Mobile Cooking Tool

## Overview:

- I created this as a UX/UI learning project to explore mobile-first cooking tools that are easy to use while actually cooking.
- Problem - People often cook with phones nearby but find it hard to scroll, read long texts, or track steps while multitasking.
- Goal - Create a mobile app that lets users quickly find and follow recipes with large steps, simple navigation, and minimal distractions.
